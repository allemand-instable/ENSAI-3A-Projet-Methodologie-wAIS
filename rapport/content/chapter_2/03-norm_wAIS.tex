\subsection{Normalized Importance Sampling}


Often, the target distribution $f$ from which we wish to sample is only known up to a proportional constant. In that scenario, "naive" importance sampling will yield a biased estimate. Normalized importance sampling provides a solution to that issue as demonstrated by the following: 

$$\mathbb E_f \left[ h_\theta(X) \right]$$

$$f(x) = \frac{\varphi(x)}{K} = \frac{\varphi(x)}{ \int f(u) du}$$

$f$ is the density and $K$ is the normalizaion constant. As K is unknown, one replaces $\omega_\theta$ by $W_\theta(x) = \frac{\varphi(x)}{q_\theta(x)}$. 
This yields:

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mathbb E_{q_\theta}\left[ W_\theta(X) h_\theta(X) \right] &=& \mathbb E_{q_\theta}\left[ \frac{\varphi(X)}{q_\theta(X)} h_\theta(X) \right]
\\
&=& \displaystyle\int \frac{\varphi(u)}{q_\theta(u)} h_\theta(u) \times q_\theta(u) du
\\
&=& \displaystyle\int \varphi(u) h_\theta(u)du
\\
&=& K \displaystyle\int \underbrace{\frac{\varphi(u)} K}_{f(u)} h_\theta(u)du
\\
&=& K \times \mathbb E_{f}\left[ h_\theta(X) \right]
\end{array}$$

The resulting value is proportional to the unknown constant K. We would like to rid ourselves of $K$. Fortunately, the following holds:

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mathbb E_{q_\theta}\left[ W_\theta(X) \right] 
&=& \mathbb E_{q_\theta}\left[ \frac{\varphi(X)}{q_\theta(X)} \right]
\\
&=&
\displaystyle \int \frac{\varphi(u)}{q_\theta(u)} * q_\theta(u) du 
\\
&=&
\displaystyle\int K f(u) du 
\\
&=& K \displaystyle\int f(u) du 
\\
&=& K
\end{array}
$$

The latter is due to $f$ being a density of which the integral equates to 1. Hence, the normalized importance sampling estimator takes the shape: 

$$\nabla L(\theta) \approx \frac{ \frac 1 N \displaystyle\sum\limits_{t=1}^{n_t}\sum_{i=1}^N \omega_{\theta_t}(X_i) h_{\theta_t}(X_i)}
{\frac 1 N \displaystyle\sum\limits_{t=1}^{n_t}\sum_{i=1}^{n_t} \omega_{\theta_t}(X_i)}$$


with:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(X_i)$  sampled according to $q_\theta$
\item $h_\theta : x \mapsto \nabla_\theta \ \log q_\theta(x)$ 
\item $f : x \mapsto \varphi(x) / \int f(u)du$
\item $W_\theta : x \mapsto \varphi(x) / q_\theta(x)$
\end{itemize}

An appropriate sampling policy in the case of normalized importance sampling is given by :

$q \propto |\varphi - \displaystyle \int \varphi \pi|\pi$. Again, the issue arises that suitable sampling policies can generally not be sampled from, but must be approximated. In this case, one may resort to normalized AIS. \cite{douc2007minimum} The concept of normalized importance sampling will prove important in the simulation section as \cite{portierdelyonWAIS} recommends the usage of normalized wAIS.
