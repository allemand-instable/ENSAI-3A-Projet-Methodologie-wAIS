\subsubsection{Testing the distribution convergence}

The normal [fig \ref{sim:normal}] and logistic [fig \ref{sim:logistic}] distributions seem to gain a lot of speed in convergence when using $\displaystyle{\frac 1 n \sum\limits_i \nabla_\theta \left[ \left( \frac{f(x_i)}{q_t(x_i)}\right) \cdot \log q_t(x_i) \right]}$. 
We are not sure of the mathematical explanation on why it behaves this way, one might consider to derive a result from the fact both distributions are from the quadratic exponential family as described in Gourieux, Montfort and Trognon~\cite{pmle}.

$$f(x \vert \begin{bmatrix}
    m \\ \Sigma
\end{bmatrix}) = \exp \left[ A(m, \Sigma) + B(x) + C(m, \Sigma)x + x^* D(m, \Sigma) x \right]$$
